A simple message queue for commands and events (CQRS) for Django.

* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-queuebie/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ambient-innovation/django-queuebie)
* [Full documentation](https://django-queuebie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* Creator & Maintainer: [Ambient Digital](https://ambient.digital/)


## Features

* Split up your business logic in commands and events
* Commands are imperatives telling your system what to do, events reflect that something has happened
* Register light-weight functions via a decorator to listen to your commands and events
* Message handlers receive the context of the message (command or event), providing an explicit API
* No magic, no side effects since the queue works synchronously

```python
import dataclasses

from queuebie.runner import handle_message
from queuebie.messages import Command, Event
from queuebie import message_registry


# Example command
@dataclasses.dataclass(kw_only=True)
class BuyProduct(Command):
    product_id: int
    customer_id: int
    price: float
    currency: str


# Example event
@dataclasses.dataclass(kw_only=True)
class ProductBought(Event):
    product_id: int
    customer_id: int


# Example handler
@message_registry.register_command(BuyProduct)
def handle_buy_product(context: BuyProduct) -> Event:
    # Here lives your business logic

    return ProductBought(
        product_id=context.product_id,
        customer_id=context.customer_id,
    )


# Start queue and process messages
handle_message(
    BuyProduct(
        product_id=product.id,
        customer_id=customer.id,
        price=12.99,
        currency="EUR",
    )
)
```

## Installation

- Install the package via pip:

  `pip install django_queuebie`

  or via pipenv:

  `pipenv install django_queuebie`

- Add module to `INSTALLED_APPS` within the main django `settings.py`:

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        "queuebie",
    )
    ```



## Contribute

### Setup package for development

- Create a Python virtualenv and activate it
- Install "pip-tools" with `pip install -U pip-tools`
- Compile the requirements with `pip-compile --extra dev, -o requirements.txt pyproject.toml --resolver=backtracking`
- Sync the dependencies with your virtualenv with `pip-sync`

### Add functionality

- Create a new branch for your feature
- Change the dependency in your requirements.txt to a local (editable) one that points to your local file system:
  `-e /Users/workspace/django-queuebie` or via pip  `pip install -e /Users/workspace/django-queuebie`
- Ensure the code passes the tests
- Create a pull request

### Run tests

- Run tests
  ````
  pytest --ds settings tests
  ````

- Check coverage
  ````
  coverage run -m pytest --ds settings tests
  coverage report -m
  ````

### Git hooks (via pre-commit)

We use pre-push hooks to ensure that only linted code reaches our remote repository and pipelines aren't triggered in
vain.

To enable the configured pre-push hooks, you need to [install](https://pre-commit.com/) pre-commit and run once:

    pre-commit install -t pre-push -t pre-commit --install-hooks

This will permanently install the git hooks for both, frontend and backend, in your local
[`.git/hooks`](./.git/hooks) folder.
The hooks are configured in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](templates/.pre-commit-config.yaml.tpl).

You can check whether hooks work as intended using the [run](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-run) command:

    pre-commit run [hook-id] [options]

Example: run single hook

    pre-commit run ruff --all-files

Example: run all hooks of pre-push stage

    pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage push

### Update documentation

- To build the documentation, run: `sphinx-build docs/ docs/_build/html/`.
- Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` to see the documentation.


### Translation files

If you have added custom text, make sure to wrap it in `_()` where `_` is
gettext_lazy (`from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _`).

How to create translation file:

* Navigate to `django-queuebie`
* `python manage.py makemessages -l de`
* Have a look at the new/changed files within `queuebie/locale`

How to compile translation files:

* Navigate to `django-queuebie`
* `python manage.py compilemessages`
* Have a look at the new/changed files within `queuebie/locale`


### Publish to ReadTheDocs.io

- Fetch the latest changes in GitHub mirror and push them
- Trigger new build at ReadTheDocs.io (follow instructions in admin panel at RTD) if the GitHub webhook is not yet set
  up.

### Publish to PyPi

- Update documentation about new/changed functionality

- Update the `Changelog`

- Increment version in main `__init__.py`

- Create pull request / merge to main

- This project uses the flit package to publish to PyPI. Thus, publishing should be as easy as running:
  ```
  flit publish
  ```

  To publish to TestPyPI use the following to ensure that you have set up your .pypirc as
  shown [here](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upload.html#using-pypirc) and use the following command:

  ```
  flit publish --repository testpypi
  ```

### Maintenance

Please note that this package supports the [ambient-package-update](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/).
So you don't have to worry about the maintenance of this package. This updater is rendering all important
configuration and setup files. It works similar to well-known updaters like `pyupgrade` or `django-upgrade`.

To run an update, refer to the [documentation page](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/)
of the "ambient-package-update".
